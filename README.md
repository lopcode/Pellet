# Pellet

An opinionated Kotlin web framework, designed to be fast, lean, stable, and ergonomic.

This project is still in the prototyping phase, but you're welcome to pull it down and give it a try.

I wrote a blog post describing why I started Pellet, and what the design goals are: https://www.carrot.blog/posts/2021/11/building-pellet-introduction/

## Examples

Starting a simple server, with one HTTP connector, and one route handler at `GET /v1/hello`, which responds with a 204:

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val pellet = pelletServer {
        httpConnector {
            endpoint = PelletConnector.Endpoint(
                hostname = "localhost",
                port = 8082
            )
            router {
                get("/v1/hello") {
                    HTTPRouteResponse.Builder()
                        .noContent()
                        .header("X-Hello", "World")
                        .build()
                }
            }
        }
    }
    pellet.start().join()
}
```

Pellet will start up:
```
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Pellet server starting...
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Please support development at https://www.pellet.dev/support
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Starting connector: HTTP(hostname=localhost, port=8082)
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer -  Routes:
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer -   PelletHTTPRoute(method=GET, uri=/v1/hello, handler=dev.pellet.DemoKt$main$1$pellet$1$1$1$1@ea4a92b)
```

Then you can hit this endpoint locally using [httpie](https://httpie.io/):
```
ü•ï carrot üóÇ ~/git/pellet $ http -v localhost:8082/v1/hello
GET /v1/hello HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: localhost:8082
User-Agent: HTTPie/2.6.0



HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
x-hello: World
```

You can find more examples in the `demo` subproject.
