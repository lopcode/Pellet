# Pellet

An opinionated Kotlin web framework, designed to be fast, lean, stable, and ergonomic.

Pellet handles a huge number of requests per second, has a tiny dependency graph (`kotlin-stdlib`, `kotlinx-coroutines`, and `slf4j-api`), and offers approximately one way of doing things.

This project is still in the prototyping phase, but you're welcome to pull it down and give it a try.

I write about building Pellet in a series on my blog: https://www.carrot.blog/series/pellet/

## Examples

Starting a simple server, with one HTTP connector, and one route handler at `GET /v1/hello`, which responds with a 204:

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val pellet = pelletServer {
        httpConnector {
            endpoint = PelletConnector.Endpoint(
                hostname = "localhost",
                port = 8082
            )
            router {
                get("/v1/hello") {
                    HTTPRouteResponse.Builder()
                        .noContent()
                        .header("X-Hello", "World")
                        .build()
                }
            }
        }
    }
    pellet.start().join()
}
```

Pellet will start up:
```
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Pellet server starting...
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Please support development at https://www.pellet.dev/support
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Starting connector: HTTP(hostname=localhost, port=8082)
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer -  Routes:
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer -   PelletHTTPRoute(method=GET, uri=/v1/hello, handler=dev.pellet.DemoKt$main$1$pellet$1$1$1$1@ea4a92b)
[main] INFO dev.pellet.PelletServer - Pellet started in 16ms
```

Then you can hit this endpoint locally using [httpie](https://httpie.io/):
```
ü•ï carrot üóÇ ~/git/pellet $ http -v localhost:8082/v1/hello
GET /v1/hello HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: localhost:8082
User-Agent: HTTPie/2.6.0



HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
X-Hello: World
```

You can find more examples in the `demo` subproject.
